Personal information is used only to assist the organisation in providing an effective service and to collect broad demographic information.
If you are identified by IP or equivalent method as belonging to a customer organization such as university or a company then we will also collect the identity of that organization and use it to create usage reports which show the organization how much of the content we publish is being read by their students, members or employees.

A personal account is required to purchase content directly or to receive personal services like newsletters and alerts.
A range of information such as name and email is collected to create a personal login.
The use of your personal data for behavioural advertising and profiling is done with consent.
However the user can object to the use of their personal data for direct marketing at any time in which case the organisation refrains from any processing to the extent it is related to such purposes.
